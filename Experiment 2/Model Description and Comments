 Explanation:

Logic Behind the SimpleNeuron:
This code implements a simple neuron model, also known as a perceptron, to understand the behavior of NAND and XOR gates. The neuron uses a step activation function to predict the output based on weighted inputs.

NAND Gate:
- Linearly Separable: The model successfully learns the NAND gate as the data points can be separated by a straight line.
- Prediction: The neuron adjusts its weights through learning until it accurately predicts the NAND logic.

XOR Gate:
- Non-Linearly Separable: A single neuron cannot learn the XOR pattern because the data points cannot be separated with a single straight line.
- Limitation: XOR requires multiple layers or a more advanced architecture to solve.

Key Insights:
- Perceptrons excel with linearly separable problems.
- Complex, non-linear problems like XOR need multi-layer models.
